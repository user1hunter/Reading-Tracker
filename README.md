### Application Overview

Reading-Tracker is a web-app that lets a user create a list of books they are reading and keep up with where they last left off. A lot like a Virtual Bookmark!

## Purpose & Motivation
The purpose of this final capstone is to display all the things I have learned about in NSS, and just like my front end capstone I chose a subject that is a hobby of mine and something I care about. I enjoy cooking and finding new recipes, so my inspiration was a social media site specifically dedicated to people sharing their recipe ideas.

## How does this application work?
I used the React library, as well as ReactStrap, to create the client side of the application and C# using the .NET framework to create the server side of the application. Users are able to create, read, update, and delete data in the client by accessing the database through various Http requests that my server side controllers and repositories handle.

## How to install and run
Steps to run my project, after having cloned this repo from GitHub:
1. Run both of the SQL setup scripts found in the SQL directory, setup before seed data
2. Run the server through visual studios
3. Run 'npm start' in the client directory
4. Log in as a pre existing user in the database
